        <p>Leuven is a rather small town and the center can be easily reached on foot. 
            You will also see many cyclists here. (Foreign) students can rent a bike at Velo , 
            while others can join Fietspunt  (partner of Velo) or Blue-bike .
            However, if you have to take the bus (for somewhere outside the city center, for example), 
            look back on the website of De Lijn  (for Flanders) or TEC (for Wallonia, as Leuven is close 
            to the language line ) for travel times and routes.</p>
