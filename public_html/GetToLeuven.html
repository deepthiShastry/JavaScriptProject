    <P>The easiest way to get there from elsewhere in Belgium or even abroad from Leuven is by train. 
        There are direct and indirect connections from most Belgian cities, 
        as well as from Brussels National Airport. For travel times, look best 
        on the site of the SNCB , the National Society of Belgian Railways.</p><br>
    <p><B>BUS</B></p>
    <P>If you are in the vicinity of the city or in a village without a train station, the bus is also an option. 
        For bus journeys and routes in Flanders, visit the website of De Lijn , the Flemish bus company.</p><br>
     <p><B>CAR</B></p>
    <P>Parking in Leuven is misery , as we say. The city recently recycled the entire circulation and parking plan, leaving almost all of the above-ground parking places for non-residents. 
        You look at the website of Stad Leuven for a last moment..</p><br>
